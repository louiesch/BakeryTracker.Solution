9:37 am - just wanted to clarify, I had started the project under a different name, but decided to rename it. I had already run dotnet restore and that somehow messed everything up when I changed the name of the project. I had to import it all over into this new project. All the work in this project was done between 8am and now, just copied over from old not functional project, hence the lack of commits until this point.
