9:37 am - just wanted to clarify, I had started the project under a different name, but decided to rename it to differentiate between the overall bakery vs the orders. I had already run dotnet restore and that somehow messed everything up when I changed the name of the project. I had to import it all over into this new project. All the work in this project so far was done between 8am and now, just copied over from old not functional project, hence the lack of commits until this point.
